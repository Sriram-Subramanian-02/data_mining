product development services.\\n\\nthe past decade has seen developments in several areas of industry such as of cad/cae and cam.\\nfrom the perspective of a complete representation of a system for decision making the\\ncad/cae/cam solutions were found insufficient and the need for visualization was felt. thus, cad\\nneutral visualization products were developed. but the complete interaction with a virtual product or\\na system in an immersive environment was found to be very powerful in decision making and\\ncompressing development time. this class of manpower with such knowledge and interest in\\npursuing research in the area of developing virtual environment for specific cases was not found as\\nthere were no programmes offered at the master level with the necessary inputs. as a result, me\\nprogramme on virtual prototyping and digital manufacturing was started in the year 2012. defence\\ninfrastructure\\nlaboratories of govt. of\\ndevelopment, facility planners for
